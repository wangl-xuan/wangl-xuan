# My profile
Hi, I'm Lucly. I have learnt Digital Technology class in year 9. I know how to write HTML and CSS and created 3D models in Blender.

I have made a website about [Iceland](https://wangl-xuan.github.io/Lucky-Wang-year-10-website/) and three models last year.
- name tag
- a penguin
- a little fox
<p>I chose to study digital technology because I am interested in computer and math. I want to make an engine model and a website about it in the future.</p>
